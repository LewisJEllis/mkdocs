# Frequently Asked Questions

## Why does this site exist?

The community of Rust builders has collectively figured out tons of great building tips, loot room layouts, base designs, and more, but they're all scattered across hundreds (if not thousands) of youtube videos, imgur albums, reddit threads, and who knows what else.

Many older building guides or videos might be misleading, talking about backwards doors or featuring designs that simply don't work anymore due to various game patches. Some designs are no longer ideal due to meta shifts or the introduction of components.

There are tons of great tutorials, guides, and videos from which to pick up bits of building knowledge here and there, but there hasn't been a good single place for someone to start off or refer to when learning about Rust building or looking for info on a particular building pattern. This site was made to fix that.

You should be able to find all sorts of building knowledge here:

- General building knowledge guides, from beginner to advanced levels
    - How to evaluate a base design and what makes a base good
    - How to take your building to the next level, no matter what level you're at
- Every building tip and trick under the sun
- Breakdowns of different purposes for and categories of bases
- Collections of some of the best and most common base designs for different purposes
- Various base building details and patterns like airlocks, external TCs, loot rooms, peep holes, fireman's chutes, etc
- Curated, easily discoverable links to many of the existing resources on Rust building that already exist

This site should be a useful resource if you find yourself thinking:

- I want to learn more stuff about some aspect of building
- I want to show someone details on a good base design I've seen
- I remember some neat building trick or pattern, but I need a refresher on it
- I want to build a base of a particular size or for a particular purpose - what are good options for that?

This site should ultimately be the grand guide and reference to everything about building in Rust. If there's something worth knowing about Rust building, hopefully it's on here; if not, we want to add it.

## What's that building simulator thing in all the screenshots?

It's called [Fortify](http://store.steampowered.com/app/505040/), and it's awesome. You should buy it, it's a dollar.

## What's a good building server?

[Bob The Builder](http://bobrust.com/) runs two good modded creative/build servers.
