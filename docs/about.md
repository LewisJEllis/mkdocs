# About RustBuilding.com

### Or, why this site exists.

The community of Rust builders has collectively figured out tons of great building tips, loot room layouts, base designs, and more, but they're all scattered across hundreds (if not thousands) of youtube videos, imgur albums, reddit threads, and who knows what else.

Many older building guides or videos might be misleading, talking about techniques that are no longer needed or featuring designs that simply can't be built anymore due to various game patches. Some designs are no longer ideal due to meta shifts or the introduction of components.

There are tons of great tutorials, guides, and videos from which to pick up bits of building knowledge here and there, but **there hasn't been a good single place** for someone to start off or refer to when learning more about Rust building or looking for info on a particular building pattern. This site was made to fix that.

### What can I find here? 
All sorts of building knowledge:

- General building guides, from beginner to advanced levels
- Every building tip and trick under the sun
- What makes a base hard to raid, and how to think like a raider
- Breakdowns of different purposes for and categories of bases
- Collections of some of the best and most common base designs for different purposes
- Various base building details and patterns like airlocks, external TCs, loot rooms, peep holes, fireman's chutes, etc
- Curated, easily discoverable links to many of the resources on Rust building that already exist

This site should be a useful resource if you find yourself thinking:

- I want to learn more stuff about some aspect of building
- I want to show someone details on a good base design I've seen
- I remember some neat building trick or pattern, but I need a refresher on it
- I want to build a base of a particular size or for a particular purpose - what are some good options for that?

This site should ultimately be the grand guide and reference to everything about building in Rust. If there's something worth knowing about Rust building, hopefully it's on here; if not, we want to add it.
